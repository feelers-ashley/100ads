              ~ Here at Feelers, we’ve been thinking a lot about our roles and
              relations to one another and to our artists in the Labs projects,
              as well as the processes we’re supporting (and in my case, also
              observing). These thoughts are driven by questions such as: how do
              we document the slow process of experimentation, capture the
              social, emotional, virtual and immaterial aspects of the process,
              and reflect on the process of creation and dialogue between the
              artist, the work, and their audiences? For me, it always begins
              from a subjective position, as a participant, but also as a
              companion to Kai throughout her process of developing
              <em>100 Advertisements - Now Online!</em> – an online version of
              her IRL performance. <br /><br />

              Through recording our discussions, collecting snippets of
              reflections, observing the responses of various test audiences
              through the rehearsals, what follows is an interpretation of Kai’s
              process as it unfolds. Much like the way Kai creates her
              performances in a manner that draws deeply on intuition, emotional
              connection, and personal story-telling, this page attempts to
              reflect, respond and sketch out (from a necessarily incomplete and
              individual perspective) the story of
              <em>100 Advertisements - Now Online!</em> ~<br /><br />

              Excerpts from chat with Kai and Kia Yee (Feelers)</span
            ><br /><br />

            <span class="speaker1">Kai:</span> I previously wrote about like
            making a Google Doc show. And kind of like, with the help of people
            in Feelers who might also want to do it. And I would imagine that
            actually, I also, like personally, I want to, I want to make an
            online version of my graduation show. So currently, my graduation
            show is a not-online show. And I will perform that in February. And
            then I want to, after finishing that one, focus on making an online
            version of it, which means that I will rehearse on the internet and
            stop rehearsing in a studio. I don't want to just film like a studio
            show and then stream it, this is my least preferred way of doing an
            online show. So I would still bear in mind the ideas I had with
            like, going on Google Doc and stuff, because that was an online
            show.<br /><br />

            ...<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker1">Kai:</span> Um, Martin, I don't know if
            you've ever met Martin, but I live with Martin, my partner. And he
            wants to do some Kinect videos with a pole, which I have. So I have
            a pole and he has tech. I don't know how that will develop, because
            this is the most like, tech thing that I would be doing. Yeah. So if
            we need like more equipment or something, we could chuck that into
            the budget for this project, and then make sure that the Kinect pole
            thing ends up in this show. So that's one possible direction. But
            other than that, I don't actually expect to spend like on huge, like
            tech stuff? So we'll see, I'll update you.<br /><br />

            ...<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker2">Kia Yee:</span> Yeah, other than that, I
            think on your end just be like trying to document your process as
            much as you're comfortable with, but also just so that I guess, on
            our end, we can keep track of the projects and how you work. And
            maybe if there were certain problems that came up in the process,
            you can also document that, and then cos there's something we are
            interested to, for us to learn about also. So if there are problems
            that came up, it’ll help us if you document that. And the
            documentation can be informal, it can be like your WhatsApp texts
            with someone or it can be like an email. Or if you scribble on a
            post-it you can just take a photo. So I am not particular about it
            lah, except that maybe we just try to keep it chronological as much
            as we can.<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker1">Kai:</span> Okay, great, sounds good. Thank
            you.<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker2">KY:</span> I hope your body feels better
            soon.<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker1">Kai:</span> Yeah. Okay. Yes. Thank you for
            meeting me.<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker2">KY:</span> Is it a long term injury, or is it
            a...? Are you okay?<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker1">Kai:</span> No, like, crazy shit happened. I
            was on a pole in the studio in school, and then I was like doing
            stuff, and then the pole fell over. Very classic pole dance fail. So
            then when the pole landed on my foot, like on the ball of my foot,
            it stressed the ankle. I also landed on my knee. So I thought my
            knee was the thing that got busted, but actually the foot and the
            knee, the toes and the knee ended together and then the ankle was a
            bit like weird. So yeah, I mean, it's okay, I can still walk around
            and stuff. But it’s just like I need to be a little more careful.
            Yeah. I wish I had a video of it but I don’t.<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker2">KY:</span> I'm just imagining is like… okay.
            I'll catch you over email lah, or if you want to do a call also can,
            whenever just let me know.<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker1">Kai:</span> Thank you very much!<br /><br />

            <span class="speaker2">KY:</span> Thank you, see you!

            Kai: I would like to share some footage from previous online shows
            that I have created/co-created, to give an idea of what a live,

            ><br />
            Approx 60 minutes. Performed 10-14 June 2020 at Digitale
            Theatermaschine (student festival organised at the Institute for
            Applied Theatre Studies, Gießen).<br /><br />

              ><i>‘skin on screen’</i> by Dana Maxim and Eng Kai Er</a
            ><br />
            ‘skin on screen’ is an online performance developed during the
            corona lockdown. In this performance, we perform for only one
            audience at a time. The audience meets us through their computer and
            we take them on a journey across Googledoc, YouTube, and Zoom. We
            write, read, and watch pre-made videos and hold silences together.
            We witness each other thinking, as cursors blink rhythmically on
            pages of not-yet written words. We co-create a choreography on our
            audience’s desktop, through the simultaneous opening of multiple
            windows. The performance is intimate, live, and requires
            participation.

            <strong>cue sheets</strong> (the cue sheet is what I look at, when
            I'm performing the show) can somehow also go into the Draftbacking
            process. Or, maybe you can just have a peep at them anyway and see
            if you think they're useful in some way for creating a (sensible?
            navigate-able?) archive. And of course - don't worry if you can't
            use them! They're available, if you want to use them in any way.
            I'll from now on also stick to just one googledoc for the entire
            cue-sheet evolution process (so that it's draftback-friendly).<br />

                      _ Feeling overwhelmed and whether it needs to be offset
                      for people who can’t keep track of all the different
                      elements.<br />
                      _ Kai: said that it’s something she takes into
                      consideration and mentions in the google doc, like there’s
                      no need to keep track of everything. <br />
                      _ enjoyed chaos of Google Doc interactions but might be
                      different if participants were strangers. what are the
                      rules of engagement on the Google Doc?<br />
                      _ Kai: Mentioned that there might not be a need to show
                      her face, questioned if cameras should be off. Question
                      about sound / silence and what other types of sound there
                      can be.<br /><br />

                      _ Question for Kai: what were her intentions or arc for
                      the piece?<br />
                      _ Kai: To develop an online performance space that feels
                      live, composition experiment with online elements. Also to
                      entertain. And to make it easy for people to enter, join
                      and participate<br /><br />

                      _ Comment: Kai’s works have a quality that is about the
                      journey that the audience goes through together with her.
                      It’s about the way that she tells the story, and the
                      devices used usually emerge from the story that she tells.
                      It’s about sustaining the journey that the audience takes
                      with the performer. Mentioned that they see a thread to do
                      with the body, but would like to see a greater
                      connection.<br />
                      _ Questioned the juxtaposition of the chosen devices with
                      the story, especially the ads. Enjoyed seeing the
                      visualisation of the ads in the illustrations. <br />
                      _ Agreed and specifically asked about the relationship
                      between composition and content. They found the mixture of
                      live and recorded components engaging, but asked how the
                      form related to the content. How do the different elements
                      clash and resonate with each other? And what are the
                      relationships between the different blocks on the screen
                      (youtube videos, google doc, zoom.etc)<br /><br />

                      _ Question to Kai: what is the position of the
                      audience?<br />
                      _ Kai: as co-performers, improvisation partners. Also as
                      host, as kindergarten teacher. Improvising together.<br /><br />

                      _ Question: About the landing platform, and whether that
                      can be Google Doc instead of Zoom, in that the body is
                      postured differently when encountering Zoom as a starting
                      platform (hangups tied to Zoom). Where do you go and where
                      do you come back to? (moving across platforms)<br
